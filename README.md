# Volume-Control-Hand-Gesture
# Self-Balancing-Robot
## Basic Overview:
This repository contains the code, instructions, and resources for building a volume control application using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and an external library for controlling the system volume. 
The application utilizes hand gesture recognition to adjust the volume based on user input.

## Features:
+ **Hand gesture control**: 
  - The application recognizes hand gestures, such as raising or lowering the hand, to increase or decrease the volume.
+ **Real-time feedback**: 
  - The volume level is displayed on the screen in real-time, providing visual feedback to the user.
+ **Customizable gestures**: 
  - The application allows users to define their own hand gestures for volume control.
+ **Open-source libraries**: 
  - The application utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition, making it accessible and customizable.
+ **External library integration**:
  - The application integrates with an external library for controlling the system volume, providing platform-specific functionality.

## Getting Started:
+ **Install dependencies**: 
  - Install OpenCV, MediaPipe, and the external library for volume control.
+ **Download code**:
  - Download the code from this repository.
+ **Configure settings**: 
  - Adjust the code to specify the hand gestures for volume control and the external library settings.
+ **Run the application**: 
  - Execute the code to start the volume control application.

## Documentation:
+ **Code documentation**:
  - Comments and explanations within the code to understand its functionality.
+ **Gesture configuration guide**: 
  - Instructions on defining custom hand gestures for volume control.
